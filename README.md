# ShowOffGame
A game written in python with the pygame library meant to demonstrate that we as the SHS GD club mean buisness. Basic idea being a Space Invaders style game, with the teachers from Saratoga High School being turned into 8bit creatures, that attack you, the lone survivor of the High School War, and you have to stop them, eventually reaching to the king of the school, Principal P Robinson, who is a very tough battle, and uses different style of battle to trick you.
