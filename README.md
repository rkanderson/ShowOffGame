# Exploding Rectangles!
A game written in python with the pygame library. The gameplay very much resembles that of Space Invaders or Galaga. The player controls a "spaceship" (a rectangle) and gets to shoot at a bunch of enemy "spaceships" (other rectangles). Contains many beautiful 8-bit explosions.
